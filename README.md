# The Odin Project Javascript Course: Exercise 3
## Restaurant Page
Description:
This exercise asks to build a Restaurant, using npm and webpack to use essentially JavaScript exclusively to generate the website.
Concepts Tested:
* npm & webpack
* modules
* development vs production

Potential future improvementes: 
* adding responsiveness to the site, as the site currently uses absolute sizing and no relative sizing
* menu items and images could be displayed using flexbox
